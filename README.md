# Fitness Time Power BI Project (Dummy Data)

This is a Power BI project for Fitness Time, using **dummy data** to protect sensitive information.

## Project Description
This dashboard tracks gym member activity and includes the following key indicators:
- **Membership Types**: Different types of memberships (e.g., Basic, Silver, Gold)
- **Total Visits**: Number of visits per member
- **Calories Burned**: Estimated calories burned by members during their sessions
- **Ratings**: Member feedback scores for their sessions
- **Most Frequent Exercises**: The exercises most commonly performed by members

All dashboards and charts are built to work with **dummy data**, preserving the structure of the original project.

## Data
- All data is **fake/dummy** for privacy reasons
- Structure and relationships are preserved
- Example data files included:
  - `Members.csv` – member info, membership types
  - `Sessions.csv` – total visits, calories burned, ratings
  - `Exercises.csv` – most frequent exercises

## How to Use
- Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop
- All dashboards and KPIs work with the dummy data
- You can replace dummy data with real data if desired, keeping the same structure
